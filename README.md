# [B2EI](http://www.b2ei.com) energy monitor

An open source project to monitor easily your energy consumption on your building.

Developed by  [B2EI](http://www.b2ei.com) with Laravel, angularjs and some other open source frameworks and libraries.

Don't use B2EI energy monitor at the moment, it's a beta version with some bugs, we will correct them as soon as possible.


### Next steps : 
 - Add RS485 support with https://www.mikroe.com/rs485-2-click
 - Bug correction, interface finalisation and tests creation.
 - Add a charts module to create custom charts with one or many equipments.
 - Add translation support (All texts are in english, we want to add french, german and spanish support)
 - Support product from XLS (actually product elements are stored on PHP class files, we will create a custom product that load all it parameters from an xls file to provide a simple way to add equipments)
 - Notification support (add toggleable notification on equipment fault)
 - Generate an image for raspberry pi (based on Raspbian).
 - Integrate Modbus server, MQTT support for AWS support and maybe an OPC server.
 - Integrate blockchain support (we are looking on ethereum smart contract to provide a smart, secure and decentralized logging provider for your data).


 ## Raspberry Pi Installation
 
 
 You can download a Rasberry pi Image based on raspbian :  [b2ei-energy-monitor.img.gz v0.9.2](http://www.b2ei.com/public/b2ei-energy-monitor/0.9.2/b2ei-energy-monitor.img.gz)
 
 To install it on your SD card use the following command (don't forget to replace /dev/mmcblk0 with the correct devise path): 
 ```bash
 gunzip --stdout b2ei-energy-monitor.img.gz | dd bs=4M of=/dev/mmcblk0
